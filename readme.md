I couldn't find a Markdown rendering tool that just works, so I wrote one. Usage is incredibly simple. Either run the program with no arguments and it will pop up a basic open file dialog allowing you to select a markdown file, or pass a file path on the command line. Regardless of the method of invocation, the specified file will be rendered in your default browser.
